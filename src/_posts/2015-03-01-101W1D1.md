**Welcome to CSS Animation 101!**

I'm delighted you've chosen to take part in this course, and hope you find it helpful and fun. Over the next four weeks we're going to learn about CSS *transitions* and *animations*. By the end you'll have a good understanding of what these and the tools to create and experiment with our own.

There will be both theory and practical examples. We'll learn how to easily create your own working environment, and look at lots of examples of animation along the way.

## Hello, I'm Donovan

I've been writing articles about CSS and other topics for the six years. I've also been designing and developing websites since the late 90's. More recently, I've written for Smashing Magazine, Net Magazine, Tuts+, Adobe Inspire and more. I post random stuff at Hop.ie, and this year I've been writing tutorials on cssanimation.rocks, all about advanced and useful animations in the browser.

During my days I work as a designer and front-end developer, and I'm a big fan of combining UX principles with fun animations in design. In the evenings I write blogs and try to make sure I'm aware of what's happening in the world of web design.

Thank you for joining me. Over the next four weeks we'll cover a lot of material. The goal is to make sure we understand what the `transition` and `animation` properties are for, how they work, and see them in action. Do feel free to save and pick up the course at your own pace.

(You can also reply to any of these emails and it'll come directly to me, or tweet me at [@donovanh](https://twitter.com/donovanh) at any time.)

## Course Structure

Here's the plan for the next four weeks.

**Week 1:** What's animation anyway? This week we'll look at why we animate. We'll also introduce the `transition` and `animation` property and some sources of inspiration.

**Week 2:** All about the **transition** property. We'll learn how transitions work, and the properties we can control to change the movement.

**Week 3:** We'll take on the **animation** property, and learn how to create keyframes that go beyond simple transitions.

**Week 4:** Bringing it all together. We'll put together some advanced examples that make use of both, look into how we can make sure our work is accessible, and share some helpful CSS resources we can apply to projects, and JavaScript tools we can use for more advanced effects.

## Bonus stuff

Along the way I'll be sharing tools to help develop animations locally, a fancy CSS animation cheat sheet, and you'll even get a super-rare Happy Rock&trade; sticker!

## Need to brush up on your CSS?

If you're new to CSS, it might be worth taking time to get familiar with the concepts. You don't need to be an expert in CSS. If you know what a property is, you'll be fine.

Some online tools and resources you might find helpful:
