# Transitions in action

Last week we introduced the `transition` and `animation` properties. It's time to delve further into transitions and see some code!

Transitions take place in the browser when an element changes from one state to another. The browser draws the frames between each state automatically to create movement.

A `transition` is a property in CSS. Just as you'd give an element a height, width, or border, we give elements transitions too.

We can write a transition in CSS like this:

    transition: background 0.5s linear;

In this case we're telling the browser that a transition of the background property, will take half a second, and use the "linear" timing function.

The above property might cause a button's background to change when hovered over:

    button {
      background: white;
      transition: background 0.5s linear;
    }

    button:hover {
      background: green;
    }

Notice the `transition` property to the first `button` reference in the CSS state. This tells the browser to apply a transition to any change of state such as on hover as well as when changing back *from* the hover state.

If we applied the transition property to the hover state only, it would only transition *to* the hover state but not back.

Let's see how this looks in action. I've set up a couple of demos. You might find these examples contain some code that isn't obvious. I'll be going into greater detail over the next few days, but do feel free to poke around at the values to see what happens.

## Example: Button transition

<div class="example">
  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/course-images/button.gif" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 24px auto; display: block;">
</div>

[Here's a CodePen](http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/MYQdZd) demonstrating the hover effect. In CodePen, you can make changes to the HTML and CSS and see the results immediately.

The important thing to look for is the any property beginning `transition-`. I've written them out long-hand for demonstration like so:

    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 0.4s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-out;

This code that tells the browser what sort of movement to generate between the non-hover state and the hover state. It tells the browser to animate *all* properties (colours, size, position), over a duration of 0.4 seconds.

Try changing some of these values. For example, change the "0.4s" to something longer, like "2s" (two seconds). How does the animation feel? You could change the property from "all" to "background".

For a fun effect, try changing the `transition-timing-function` value from `ease-out` to:

    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.59,-0.26,.33,1.42)

The cubic bezier timing function is a lot of fun. We'll cover timing functions in more detail on another day.

## Prefixes and browser compatibility

When I've given code examples, I've not included vendor prefixes. This is to make the code easier to read, but if you're using the code in production they are needed.

I like to use Autoprefixer (it's an option on Codepen, press the settings "cog" icon in the CSS section), and can be run with build tools such as Grunt or Gulp. Alternately you can manually write them out like this:

    -webkit-transition: ...;
    -moz-transition: ...;
    transition: ...;

<div class="callout">
  <h2>Homework</h2>

  <p>Edit the button in today's homework and add your own ideas. You could try changing the shape, border, or almost any property. Have some fun, the goal is to make sure you're familiar with how a transition affects the element's hover effect.</p>

  <p>For some inspiration check out this <a href="http://codepen.io/nxtonic/pen/gbZNKJ">awesome squaremelon hover style</a>. There are loads of great examples around if you are looking for ideas.</p>

  <p>If you want to go further, try creating a new CodePen with an element that changes from one thing to another on hover. See if you can have an element within it move at a different rate. Don't worry if you haven't got to this point yet, we'll cover the properties in more detail and practice this again over the next few days.</p>

**Tomorrow:** Back to theory for a moment. We'll take a look through all the `transition` properties and what they mean.
